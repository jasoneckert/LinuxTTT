# Navigating the Directory Structure
   * Open a Terminal on your Fedora Workstation virtual machine as root
   - `pwd` (you should be in /root)
   - `cd /etc/sysconfig` (switches directory using absolute pathname) 
   - `pwd` (you should be in /etc/sysconfig)
   - `cd ../..` (switches to / using relative pathname)
   - `cd root` (switches to /root using relative pathname)
   - `cd ../etc/sysconfig`	(switches to /etc/sysconfig using relative pathname)
   - `cd ~woot` (takes you to woot’s home directory)
   - `pwd` (you should be in /home/woot)
   - `cd` (takes you to your home directory, /root)    
   - `cd /boot/grub2/fonts/` (instead of typing this out, use the `[Tab]` key to autocomplete the path!)
   - `cd`   

# Viewing Directories
   * Open a Terminal on your Fedora Workstation virtual machine as root
   - `cd classfiles` 
   - `ls -F`
   - `ls -l`
   - `file *` (note the files empty and what_am_i).
   - `ls -l /dev | less` 
   - `ls -l /run/systemd/journal/dev-log` 
   - `stat /run/systemd/journal/dev-log`
   - `cd ; ls -a`
   - `ls -l classfiles/Poems/Shakespeare`
   - `ls -R classfiles/Poems`
   - `tree classfiles/Poems`

# Viewing Text Files
   * Open a Terminal on your Fedora Workstation virtual machine as root
   - `cd classfiles`
   - `cat bigfile`
   - `more bigfile` (type `h` for help, `q` to quit)
   - `less bigfile` (type `h` for help, `q` to quit)
   - `cat letter`
   - `tail -8 letter`
   - `strings letter`
   - `od -x letter`
   - `cat /etc/hosts`
   - `cat Poems/Yeats/mooncat`
   - `cat Poems/Shakespeare/* | less` 	
   - `cat Poems/Blake/tiger`
   - `head -1 Poems/Blake/tiger` 
   - `tac Poems/Blake/tiger' (permits the ability to read files from bottom up instead of top down like cat)

# Common Text Tools
   * Open a Terminal on your Fedora Workstation virtual machine as root
   - `cd classfiles`
   - `grep "I " letter` 
   - `grep -v "I " letter`
   - `grep -i love Poems/Shakespeare/*` (note the number of lines returned)
   - `wc -l Poems/Shakespeare/*` (was Shakespeare a romantic?) 

# Editing Text Files
   * Open a Terminal on your Fedora Workstation virtual machine as root
   - `nano letter` (note the legend with `[Ctrl]` key combinations)
   - `dnf install vim` (installs the full version of vi improved)
   - `vimtutor` (interactive vi tutorial, alternatively visit https://vim.is/#exercise)
   - `vi small_town` (fix the numerous typos and formatting errors, saving your changes when finished)
   - `vi ~/.vimrc` (add the line `set number` to turn on line numbering on by default)

# Managing Files & Directories
   * Open a Terminal on your Fedora Workstation virtual machine as root
   - `cd classfiles` 
   - `cp proposal1 /var`
   - `ls /var`
   - `cp proposal1 /var` (note that you are prompted to overwrite the file)
   - `cp proposal1 /var/newproposal1`
   - `ls /var`
   - `mv /var/newproposal1 new1`
   - `ls`
   - `cp -R Poems Poems2`
   - `ls`
   - `mv Poems2 Poems3`
   - `ls`
   - `rm -f new1`
   - `rm -Rf Poems3`
   - `ls`

# Finding Files
   * Open a Terminal on your Fedora Workstation virtual machine as root
   - `cd classfiles`
   - `touch newfile1`
   - `locate newfile1` (no results in the locate database for this new file)        
   - `updatedb`
   - `locate newfile1` (it works now because you updated the locate database)
   - `echo $PATH` (note the directories in PATH)
   - `which cp` (note that cp is in a directory in PATH)
   - `which newfile1` (no results are shown because newfile1 is not in PATH)
   - `cp newfile1 /usr/bin`
   - `chmod +x /usr/bin/newfile1` (this gives newfile1 execute permission, discussed later)
   - `which newfile1` (the newfile1 executable program is now shown!)
   - `find / -name “*hosts*”`
   - `find /usr -type d`

# Linking Files
   * Open a Terminal on your Fedora Workstation virtual machine as root
   - `cd classfiles`
   - `ll letter` (note that it is not hard linked or symlinked from the link count)
   - `ln letter hardletter`
   - `ll -i letter hardletter` (note the link count of 2 and duplicate inode number)
   - `rm -f hardletter`
   - `ll -i letter` (note that the link count has returned to 1)
   - `ln -s letter symletter`
   - `ll` (note the file type and target pointer)
   - `rm -f symletter`
